# Self-Driving Car Simulation

![Simulation Demo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Simulation+GIF+Demo) *(Replace with actual animation GIF)*

A real-time simulation demonstrating core autonomous vehicle concepts including perception, path planning, and control systems. The simulator visualizes how a self-driving car navigates through dynamic environments with obstacles and traffic signals.

## Key Features

- **Multi-lane Road System** with configurable lane count and width
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance** using object detection and path replanning
- **Traffic Light System** with state transitions (green/yellow/red)
- **Path Planning Algorithm** that adapts to road conditions
- **PID-like Controller** for steering and speed regulation
- **Sensor Simulation** with limited detection range
- **Real-time Visualization** using Matplotlib

```

1. **Perception System**
   - Obstacle detection within sensor range
   - Traffic light state recognition
   - Distance calculation to objects

2. **Planning System**
   - Reference path generation
   - Dynamic path modification for obstacle avoidance
   - Traffic light response logic (stop/slow down)

3. **Control System**
   - Lookahead point tracking
   - Steering angle calculation
   - Speed regulation with acceleration profiles

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-driving-car-sim.git
cd self-driving-car-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulation.py
```

## Configuration Options

Modify these parameters in the code:
- Number of lanes (`self.lanes`)
- Road length (`self.road_length`)
- Obstacle positions and sizes
- Traffic light location (`self.traffic_light_pos`)
- Vehicle parameters (`max_speed`, `acceleration`, etc.)

## Simulation Output

The animation shows:
1. Autonomous vehicle (blue rectangle)
2. Planned path (blue line)
3. Obstacles (red circles)
4. Traffic light (color-coded indicator)
5. Lane markings (dashed lines)
6. Dynamic speed display
